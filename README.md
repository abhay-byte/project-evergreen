# Project Evergreen: The Walmart Smart Retail Ecosystem

 <!-- Optional: Create a cool banner for your project -->

Welcome to the official repository for **Project Evergreen**! This project combines three powerful ideas into a single, cohesive retail platform designed to enhance customer experience, promote sustainability, and improve operational efficiency.

## ‚ú® Project Vision

Our goal is to revolutionize the retail experience by integrating intelligent, value-driven technology. We empower customers to make sustainable choices with **GreenScore**, help them visualize products in their own space with **RoomScape AI**, and reduce food waste through our AI-powered logistics platform, **Waste-Knot**.

## üöÄ Core Features

This project is a monorepo containing two main parts: a **React Native frontend** and a **Node.js (Express) backend**.

###  Frontend (Mobile App - `/frontend`)
*   **GreenScore:** A gamified system that scores products on sustainability. Users earn points and rewards for making eco-friendly choices.
*   **RoomScape AI:** An Augmented Reality feature that allows users to place photorealistic 3D models of furniture in their own room using their phone's camera.

### Backend (Server - `/backend`)
*   **Waste-Knot:** An AI-driven logistics system that identifies near-expiry food items and automates the process of donating them to local charities.
*   **Core API:** A robust REST API that serves data for products, user authentication, and donation management.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16 or later)
*   npm or yarn
*   Git
*   PostgreSQL server running locally
*   React Native development environment (follow the [official guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup))

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-evergreen.git
    cd project-evergreen
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```bash
    # Go to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create your environment file from the example
    cp .env.example .env

    # Edit .env with your local PostgreSQL credentials
    nano .env

    # Run database migrations (if using an ORM like Sequelize/Prisma)
    # npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

    # Start the server
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:3001` (or your configured port).

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    # Go to the frontend directory from the root
    cd ../frontend

    # Install dependencies
